## Problem 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array (Easy)
Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
```

## Problem 771. Jewels and Stones (Easy)
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:
```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

Example 2:
```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

Note:
```
S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.
```

## Problem 1431. Kids WIth the Greatest Number of Candies (Easy)
Given the array candies and the integer extraCandies, where candies[i] represents the number of candies that the ith kid has.

For each kid check if there is a way to distribute extraCandies among the kids such that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

Example 1:
```
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: 
Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies. 
Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 

```
Example 2:
```
Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy, therefore only kid 1 will have the greatest number of candies among the kids regardless of who takes the extra candy.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]
```

Constraints:
```
2 <= candies.length <= 100
1 <= candies[i] <= 100
1 <= extraCandies <= 50
```

## Problem 1512. Number of Good Pairs (Easy)
Given an array of integers nums.

A pair (i,j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.

Return the number of good pairs.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) 0-indexed.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Each pair in the array are good.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
 ```

Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
```

## Problem 1108. Defanging an IP Address (Easy)
Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

Example 1:
```
Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
```

Example 2:
```
Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"
```

Constraints:
```
The given address is a valid IPv4 address.
```

## Problem 1476. Subrectangle Queries (Medium)
Implement the class SubrectangleQueries which receives a rows x cols rectangle as a matrix of integers in the constructor and supports two methods:

1. updateSubrectangle(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2, int newValue)

- Updates all values with newValue in the subrectangle whose upper left coordinate is (row1,col1) and bottom right coordinate is (row2,col2).
2. getValue(int row, int col)

- Returns the current value of the coordinate (row,col) from the rectangle.
 

Example 1:
```
Input
["SubrectangleQueries","getValue","updateSubrectangle","getValue","getValue","updateSubrectangle","getValue","getValue"]
[[[[1,2,1],[4,3,4],[3,2,1],[1,1,1]]],[0,2],[0,0,3,2,5],[0,2],[3,1],[3,0,3,2,10],[3,1],[0,2]]
Output
[null,1,null,5,5,null,10,5]
Explanation
SubrectangleQueries subrectangleQueries = new SubrectangleQueries([[1,2,1],[4,3,4],[3,2,1],[1,1,1]]);  
// The initial rectangle (4x3) looks like:
// 1 2 1
// 4 3 4
// 3 2 1
// 1 1 1
subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 2); // return 1
subrectangleQueries.updateSubrectangle(0, 0, 3, 2, 5);
// After this update the rectangle looks like:
// 5 5 5
// 5 5 5
// 5 5 5
// 5 5 5 
subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 2); // return 5
subrectangleQueries.getValue(3, 1); // return 5
subrectangleQueries.updateSubrectangle(3, 0, 3, 2, 10);
// After this update the rectangle looks like:
// 5   5   5
// 5   5   5
// 5   5   5
// 10  10  10 
subrectangleQueries.getValue(3, 1); // return 10
subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 2); // return 5
```

Example 2:
```
Input
["SubrectangleQueries","getValue","updateSubrectangle","getValue","getValue","updateSubrectangle","getValue"]
[[[[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3]]],[0,0],[0,0,2,2,100],[0,0],[2,2],[1,1,2,2,20],[2,2]]
Output
[null,1,null,100,100,null,20]
Explanation
SubrectangleQueries subrectangleQueries = new SubrectangleQueries([[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3]]);
subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 0); // return 1
subrectangleQueries.updateSubrectangle(0, 0, 2, 2, 100);
subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 0); // return 100
subrectangleQueries.getValue(2, 2); // return 100
subrectangleQueries.updateSubrectangle(1, 1, 2, 2, 20);
subrectangleQueries.getValue(2, 2); // return 20
 ```

Constraints:
```
There will be at most 500 operations considering both methods: updateSubrectangle and getValue.
1 <= rows, cols <= 100
rows == rectangle.length
cols == rectangle[i].length
0 <= row1 <= row2 < rows
0 <= col1 <= col2 < cols
1 <= newValue, rectangle[i][j] <= 10^9
0 <= row < rows
0 <= col < cols
```
